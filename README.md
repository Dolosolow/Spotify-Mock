This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Used the mobile first design approach. So it would be best to view in mobile view or a mobile device (save to home screen).

## Live Demo

In the following link there is the live demo of the app in its current state. Missing some other functions, Authentication, authorization, Redux and linking to a DB.
